    This class manages and coordinates ingestion of acquisition plans:
        for each mission, it performs the following steps:
        1. retrieves (using a AcqPlanPageParser)
            a list of url links for each mission satellite from teh latest acqplan page
            (associated to the url of the host page)
        2. if configured, integrates the list of url links with those from archive page
        3. Each link is associated to the relevant date/time interval
        4. A selection is performed (according to rules and configuration),
            by knowing current contents of KML repository, and already downloaded files:
            the retrieved url links are filtered
        5. the AcqPlan KML files corresponding to the selected URL links are downloaded and loaded on KML Repository:
            For each link, using a Acqplan downloader, each of the url link is downloaded to a temporary file/string
            Note: the link is relative to the page it was retrieved from !
        6.  after the file is downloaded a KML Splitter is executed on the downloaded file
        7   the Fragments are passed to the AcqPlan KML Repository Loader
            AcaPlanTable.add_fragment (kml_file,  kml_folder, folder_interval, mission, satellite )
            TBD: who requests purging the oldest KML folders?
            Formats are associated to one day
            Fragments could be not saved on repository if too old (Age configurable)
        8. When all the links have been processed, Flask Cache is updated (HOW?)
            NO: Caller updates cache with Repository Contents
